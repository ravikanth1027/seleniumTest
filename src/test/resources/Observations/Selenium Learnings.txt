Hear I was trying to run front end automation using Marionette .  Most of the tutorials have given the driver setup as 

	System.setProperty("webdriver.gecko.driver",driverPath+"geckodriver");
		DesiredCapabilities capabilities = DesiredCapabilities.firefox();
		capabilities.setCapability("marionette",true);
		driver = new FirefoxDriver(capabilities);	
But from the observations It was found that when we five gecko.driver , browser is opening but was not able to start any session . Hence failing the cases throwing the error for same

Fix :
   
	System.setProperty("webdriver.firefox.marionette",driverPath+"geckodriver");
		DesiredCapabilities capabilities = DesiredCapabilities.firefox();
		capabilities.setCapability("marionette",true);
		driver = new FirefoxDriver(capabilities);
